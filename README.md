# HATE
The Undertale Corruptor.

Howdy! I'm RED. RED the [REDACTED]!

And this is the Undertale Corruptor!
What does it do, you may ask?
It allows you to shuffle game's internal data around, corrupting music, gfx and text as a result.
Interested?

INSTALLATION GUIDE:

1. Move HATE.exe to Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Undertale  

UNINSTALLATION GUIDE:

1. Run HATE with all options turned off. It should have "RESTORE" instead of "CORRUPT" on the button.
2. Delete HATE.

WHAT ABOUT MAC / LINUX:

I think Wine works with Windows Forms, but don't have a *nix to try it out on.
