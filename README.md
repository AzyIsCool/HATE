# HATE
The Undertale Corruptor.

Howdy! I'm RED. RED the [REDACTED]!

And this is the Undertale Corruptor!
What does it do, you may ask?
It allows you to shuffle game's internal data around, corrupting music, gfx and text as a result.

INSTALLATION GUIDE:

1. Move HATE.exe and "bin" to Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Undertale

3. Have fun, you don't need to move any other files

UNINSTALLATION GUIDE:

A. Easier but Slower:  
1. Remove everything in Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Undertale folder and let it redownload.

B. Harder but Faster:  
1. Move Undertale.exe, located in folder Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Undertale/Undertale anywhere really.  
2. Remove everything in Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Undertale folder.  
3. Move the Undertale.exe back into the Program Files (x86)/Steam/steamapps/common/Undertale folder.

WHAT ABOUT MAC / LINUX:

I think Wine works with Windows Forms, but don't have a *nix to try it out on.
